save-forlater
-------------

Firefox and Chrome extensions to save a page via forlater. Check the
releases page.

NOTE: Chrome extensions can't be trivially installed without it being
published on the Chrome Web Store -- something that I don't plan on
doing. You can manually install it like so:

• Head to chrome://extensions
• Enable 'Developer mode' (top right)
• Unzip the downloaded .crx file
• Click on 'Load unpacked' and point it to the unzipped directory

Or just use Firefox.
